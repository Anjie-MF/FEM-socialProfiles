## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Debugging - After completing my code, I encountered an issue where the live preview wouldn't open in the browser window. With guidance from ChatGPT, I explored the 'Network' tab in Chrome DevTools. This not only helped me identify the root cause of the problem but also provided valuable insights into resource loading, performance optimization, and understanding status codes.

### Continued development

Accessibility: Use semantic HTML elements and provide alternative text for images (alt attribute).

Consistency: Try to make CSS more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by using classes and styles more efficiently. (A new phrase I just learned today; will link article in the Resources)

Performance: Optimizing my assets (images, CSS, JS) for faster loading times.
